# Investair Initiating Coverage — Report Structure

Section order and content rules, modeled on Investair's house style for
single-company initiation notes. Follow this order; omit a section only if
the underlying data genuinely does not exist for this company (state why).

## Header block

- Company name, ASX ticker, sector (e.g. "Materials")
- One-line strapline summarizing the investment case
- Stat row: Share price (as-at date) · Market cap · Estimated EV · Cash
  runway · 12-month price return · (EV/resource-oz if a resource figure was
  supplied)
- Tag line: commodity, jurisdiction, lifecycle stage, next major catalyst

## 1. Investment Highlights

3–6 numbered highlights, each one bolded headline phrase followed by 1–3
sentences of supporting detail sourced from the data pulled (market
snapshot, cashflow, announcements). Order roughly by materiality to the
investment case (valuation anomaly, flagship asset quality, recent
newsflow, funding position, corporate activity, catalysts).

## 2. Valuation Framework

Short intro paragraph noting that resource-stage/pre-revenue companies are
valued on relative metrics, not DCF, until a scoping study or PFS exists.

Present each applicable metric as a labeled stat card (metric name, one-line
category tag, the number, and 1–2 sentences of interpretation):

- **EV per Resource Ounce** — EV ÷ resource ounces (only if a resource
  figure was supplied — see SKILL.md step 2)
- **Market Cap per Resource Ounce** — market cap ÷ resource ounces
- **Cash Backing per Share** — cash ÷ shares on issue, and as a % of share price
- **Cash as % of Market Cap** — funding-risk indicator; flag values below
  ~15% as signaling near-term capital-raising pressure
- **EV per km² of tenure** — if project area data is available; a
  pre-resource land-value proxy
- **Annual Exploration Spend / Market Cap** — annualized burn ÷ market cap;
  an exploration-intensity proxy

State plainly which metrics could not be calculated and why (e.g. "P/NAV,
EV/EBITDA and DCF-derived fair value are not applicable — no scoping study
or production economics exist yet").

## 3. Peer Group — Enterprise Value Comparison

- One paragraph (1–2 sentences) explaining why this peer set was selected,
  drawn from the fields `get_peers` returned for this `peer_source` and from
  `business_context` — plain business language only; never raw table/tier/
  engine labels. Explicitly list the peer group tickers. MCP owns the peer
  cascade — do not invent alternative peer logic or a live cashflow
  classification set.
- Table columns: Ticker, Company, Country/Focus, Stage, Market Cap (A$M),
  Cash (A$M), EV (A$M), Burn/Qtr (A$M), Runway (Qtrs). Sort by EV ascending
  within similarly-sized peers; call out larger/more-advanced peers
  separately if the EV range spans an order of magnitude.
- If any peer's cash figure is stale,
  footnote it rather than silently including it.
- A short paragraph positioning the target company within the peer cohort:
  where it sits on EV, what differentiates it (larger/smaller resource,
  burn rate, stage).
- If resource-ounce data is not available for peers (it will not be, by
  default — see SKILL.md), say so explicitly and note that EV/oz is
  presented for the target company only, sourced from company filings.

## 4. Company Overview

2–3 paragraphs: what the company is, where it operates, its flagship asset,
how it got there (recent corporate history if notable — acquisitions,
strategy pivots), current share price / market cap / EV / implied valuation
multiple.

## 5. Project Portfolio

Table columns: Project, Country, Commodity, Stage, Ownership, Role
(Flagship/Secondary), Notes — from `get_company_projects`.

## 6. Flagship Project Deep-Dive

For the flagship asset: location/size/tenure, resource statement (if a
figure was supplied), drilling to date vs. total strike/prospective area
(upside framing), and a subsection of **recent drilling highlights**
sourced from `list_announcements` — pull real intercepts/results, do not
invent grades or intervals.

Include a **metallurgy** subsection if testwork results appear in
announcements.

## 7. Financial Position & Capital Structure

Stat cards: estimated cash, cash runway, quarterly burn (split
exploration/operations if available), cash as % of market cap. Prose:
shares on issue, options/performance rights overhang, and — from
`list_capital_raises` — the most recent raise (price, size, post-raise DAP
performance if available) as a precedent for any upcoming raise.

Include price performance over 1/3/6/12 months if available from
`get_market_snapshot`.

## 8. Near-Term Catalysts

Chronological list (quarter/date, catalyst, why it matters), sourced from
announcements and the funding runway (a raise is itself a catalyst when
runway is short).

## 9. Key Risks

Table: Risk category, description, severity (High/Medium/Low). Always
include funding/dilution risk if runway is short, and exploration risk for
any pre-resource or resource-definition company. Add jurisdiction, price
(commodity), technical/metallurgy, ownership-structure, and liquidity risks
where relevant to the data pulled — do not list a risk with no supporting
evidence from the data.

## 10. Summary Thesis

2–3 paragraphs synthesizing the above: the core investment case, the
primary valuation observation, and the primary near-term risk. End with:
"No investment recommendation is made in this report. See disclaimer
below."
