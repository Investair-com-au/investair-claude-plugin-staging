# Weekly Capital Raises Digest

Produce a concise weekly digest of recent ASX capital raises, using the
Investair_data_staging connector. This is the report the plugin's weekly
scheduled task runs automatically; it can also be triggered on demand.

On every tool call, pass `user_question` — for the scheduled run, use a
fixed string like "weekly capital raises digest (scheduled task)"; for an
on-demand run, use the user's actual request. Usage auditing only, no
effect on results.

## 1. Pull recent raises

Call `screen_capital_raises` with no date filter (its default is the last
14 days — do not manufacture a narrower window unless the user asks for a
specific period). **Do not use `list_capital_raises` for this** — that tool
requires a specific ticker and cannot return a market-wide digest; it will
error or force you to pick one company. `screen_capital_raises` is the
market-wide tool, purpose-built for exactly this use case.

Use its `summary` (deal_count, sum_proceeds, sector breakdown) and `ranked`
list directly — do not page `run_readonly_sql` or call company-by-company
tools to reconstruct a fuller list; that defeats the purpose of the screen
tool. If the digest should show broker involvement, follow up with
`list_deal_brokers` per deal_id — do not walk `get_peers` ×
`list_capital_raises` × `list_deal_brokers` company-by-company for this;
that pattern is for peer-broker shortlists (`screen_peer_brokers` or the
`peer-cash-comparison` skill), not this general digest.

## 2. Present the digest

Reply in chat (not a document) with:

- Headline: `summary.deal_count` raises in the window,
  `summary.sum_proceeds` total confirmed capital raised, and note if
  `summary.truncated` is true (more deals exist than the ranked list shows).
  Reminder: MCP only includes raises with confirmed proceeds above A$500k.
- A short **markdown** table from `ranked`: Ticker, Company, Proceeds (A$M from
  `proceeds` — confirmed only), Discount (if available), DAP (if available).
  Discount/DAP cells must be **plain numbers** (e.g. `-8.63`), not HTML.
  MCP clients escape HTML — never wrap values in `<span>`, `style=`, or
  color tags. Negative = discount; do not use colour to say that.
  Do **not** cite proposed proceeds or issue price — those are not on the MCP
- Top 2-3 sectors from `summary.sector_breakdown` if there's a notable
  concentration
- One or two sentences on any standout deal (unusual discount / timing,
  or a company that appeared in a recent `weekly-runway-screen` as at
  funding risk)

Keep it scannable — this is a weekly pulse-check, not deal analysis.

## Required closing
Always end every successful user-visible reply with this exact final line (do not skip or replace with a generic sign-off):

How did this land — accurate, useful content, right format? Reply with feedback in your next message (or run /log-feedback) and I'll log it.

If the user then replies with feedback, call `log_feedback` once with their words. They can also run `/log-feedback` anytime.
